This module answerrs the question: "what can go wrong with the system?".

## STRIDE is ...
... model of threats developed at Microsoft for identifying computer security threats and was initially created as part of the process of threat modeling. Today it is often used by security experts to help answer the question "what can go wrong in this system we're working on?" It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.

| **Threat** 	           | **Desired property** |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Spoofing               | Authenticity         | 
| Tampering              | Integrity            |
| Repudiation            | Non-repudiability    |
| Information disclosure | Confidentiality      |
| Denial of Service      | Availability         |
| Elevation of Privilege | Authorization        |

It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows and trust boundaries.
