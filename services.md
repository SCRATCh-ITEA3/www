# Services that grow with your business

to gain an overview of SecDevOps we have three main services to offer. First an "Introduction to SecDevOps" will guide you thru the endless loop of DevOps and how to integrate security. Secondly a "self-assessment" to see the strong- and weak-points of your organisation. Thirdly a generic SecDevOps workshop for a detailed assessment. Base on these there  are many building blocks like "STRIDE" that will enhance your organisational knowledge in that area.
